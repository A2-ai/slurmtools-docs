This guide describes how to view available slurm partitions using the `get_slurm_partitions` function.

## Prerequisites

- **None**

## Viewing slurm partitions

Here's the code you'll use to view slurm partitions available to you

import view_partitions from '/src/code/view_partitions.R?raw';

<Code title="view_partitions.R" lang="r" code={view_partitions}/>

This will return a list of all available partitions:
```
[1] "cpu2mem4gb"    "cpu4mem32gb"   "cpu8mem64gb"  
[4] "cpu2mem8gb"    "cpu4mem16gb"   "cpu16mem128gb"
[7] "cpu8mem32gb"   "cpu16mem64gb"  "cpu32mem128gb"
```

<Aside type='note'>
`get_slurm_partitions` takes an optional `cache` argument which is a boolean to cache the partitions into an environment. This was used as a learning experience for cahcing and has no effect on the function.
