This guide describes how to submit a NONMEM job to slurm using the `submit_nonmem_model` function. First, make sure you have loaded `slurmtools` and are familiar with the [needed options](/guides/1_getting_started) to use slurmtools.

## Prerequisite files and programs

To use `submit_nonmem_model` you need a few things set before hand
<Steps>
1. A [template file](/guides/simple_template_file) ready to be populated
2. All files needed to run NONMEM - control stream and data
3. [`bbr`](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbr) installed in your R environment
4. A way of running NONMEM such as bbi or nmm
</Steps>
<Aside type="note">Depending on the complexity of your template file you might need additional information as well!</Aside> 

Once these are set, you're ready to roll with your Slurm submission! 

## Submitting a NONMEM job
Here's the code you'll use to submit a job with submit_nonmem_model, this uses default values for all arguments, many of which are determined via the `slurmtools` options discussed [here](/guides/1_getting_started).

import submit_code from '/src/submit.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code = {submit_code} />

With all prerequisites in place, running this code sends your NONMEM model to Slurm. Let’s look at what you can expect from the output.

<Aside type="note">If you've already submitted the model, `submit_nonmem_model` by default will not overwrite and existing model. Check out [`submit_nonmem_model` Reference Guide](/reference/submit_nonmem_model_reference) for more details on the overwrite argument.</Aside>

## Understanding the output
```r
$status
[1] 0

$stdout
[1] "Submitted batch job 436"

$stderr
[1] ""

$timeout
[1] FALSE
```

- **$status**: This shows an exit code of `0`, which means everything went smoothly.
- **$stdout**: Here, you’ll see a message confirming your job submission, along with the job ID (e.g., 436).
- **$stderr**: If all goes well, this should be empty.
- **$timeout**: A `FALSE` value here means there was no timeout during the submission.

<Aside type="tip"path> A status code of 0 is what you want! It indicates there were no issues. </Aside>
