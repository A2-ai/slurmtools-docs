import { Aside, Code, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

When calling `submit_slurm_job(mod)` the template file supplied through [`slurmtools` options](/slurmtools-docs/guides/1_getting_started#slurmtools-options), or the [`slurm_job_template_path` argument](/slurmtools-docs/reference/submit_slurm_job_reference#using-the-slurm_job_template_path-argument) is populated and submitted to slurm as a bash job. This setup offers extensive customization options through `slurmtools`, allowing you to adapt job configurations to suit your specific needs.

## Simple template file

Below is a simple template file that can be used to submit NONMEM jobs to slurm with [`bbi`](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbi) <span style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><Icon name="external" /></span>.

import tmpl from '/src/code/simple-template.tmpl?raw';

<Code title='slurm-job.tmpl' lang='bash' code={tmpl}/>

The template file uses the [whisker package](https://github.com/edwindj/whisker?tab=readme-ov-file)<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><Icon name="external" /></span> to fill in variables according to the [Mustache templating standard](https://mustache.github.io)<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><Icon name="external" /></span>. When `submit_slurm_job` is called, it reads the template file and injects both the [default values provided to the template](/slurmtools-docs/reference/values_provided_to_template) and any values passed in via the [`slurm_template_opts` argument](/slurmtools-docs/reference/submit_slurm_job_reference#using-the-slurm_template_opts-argument). Variables in the template file are denoted with double curly brackets, such as `{{ injected_variable }}`, and these placeholders are replaced with the respective values when submit_slurm_job runs.

<Aside type="note"> 
If a variable in the template file is not supplied to `submit_slurm_job`, it will remain blank in the final output.

Here’s an example of a filled-in template file after calling submit_slurm_job(mod):

import filled_tmpl from '/src/code/filled-simple-template.sh?raw';

<Code title='1001.sh' lang='bash' code={filled_tmpl}/>

## Understanding the tempalte file

This template file contains many aspects, the top 6 lines (starting with `$SBATCH --<option>`) define the slurm options for the job. next, there are two logical blocks:
```
{{#parallel}}
<parallel code>
{{/parallel}}
```
This block executes the `<parallel code>` if `parallel == TRUE`. The next block:
```
{{^parallel}}
<not parallel code>
{{/parallel}}
```
executes is `parallel == FALSE`.

This logic allows for versatile control flow, enabling you to build more complex template files to fit various job requirements.

## Next steps

<Aside type='tip'>
The filled-in template file is executed as a bash script, so anything you can run in a bash environment is possible with `submit_slurm_job`! You’re limited only by your creativity!
