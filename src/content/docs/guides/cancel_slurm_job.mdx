This guide describes how to cancel jobs submitted to slurm using the `cancel_slurm_jobs` function.

## Prerequisites
<Steps>
1. Submit a job to slurm (see [How to submit a NONMEM job to slurm](/slurmtools-docs/guides/submit_slurm_job))
2. Job ID of the job you wish to cancel
</Steps>

## Cancelling slurm jobs

</Aside>

Here's the code you'll use to cancel slurm jobs currently running or configuring

import cancel_job from '/src/code/cancel_job.R?raw';

<Code title="view_partitions.R" lang="r" code={cancel_job}/>
This will prompt you to confirm the cancellation:
```r
You are about to cancel job: 12345. Are you sure you want to cancel? [Y/n]
```

Entering `Y` will cancel the job `12345`.

## Next Steps

See the [`cancel_slurm_job` reference guide](/slurmtools-docs/reference/cancel_slurm_job_reference) for more detailed explanation of the function.
