This guide assumes you are familiar with submitting NONMEM jobs using the [default arguments](/slurmtools-docs/guides/submit_slurm_job), and are looking for more control over you job submission. We'll cover each argument to `submit_slurm_job` and overriding the default. You should be able to combine any combination of arguments to suit your needs.

### Using the `partition` & `ncpu` arguments
By default, `submit_slurm_job` uses the smallest partition available to you. This could be something like `cpu2mem4gb`. For models requiring more memory or CPUs, you can specify these arguments to better suit your needs. To view available partitions, refer to [get_slurm_partitions](/slurmtools-docs/guides/get_slurm_partitions).

#### specifying a higher memory `partition`

import submit_code_part from '/src/code/submit_partition.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code_part} />

#### Using more cores with `ncpu`
Set `ncpu` to any number up to the number of cores in your partition. For instance, with the cpu16mem128gb partition, ncpu can be set from 1 to 16.

import submit_code_ncpu from '/src/code/submit_ncpu.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code_ncpu} />

<Aside type="caution">
  Setting `ncpu` to a number higher than the partition allows will give you an error with a note of suggested partitions:

  ```r
  > submission <- slurmtools::submit_slurm_job(mod, ncpu = 13)

  Error in `check_slurm_partitions()`:
  ! number of requested CPUs (13) greater than number of available CPUs in cpu2mem4gb (2)
  You might try cpu16mem64gb or cpu16mem128gb
  ```
  We can see we should try setting `partition = cpu16mem64gb` or `cpu16mem128gb`
</Aside>

### Using the `overwrite` argument
By default, `submit_slurm_job` will not overwrite previously run models. Set `overwrite = TRUE` to override this.

import submit_code from '/src/code/submit_overwrite.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code} />

### Using the `dry_run` argument
By default, `dry_run = FALSE` and the `sbatch` command is executed. Setting `dry_run = TRUE` allows you to preview the template file without submitting it.

import submit_code_dry from '/src/code/submit_dry.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code_dry} />
This gives the following output
```r
$cmd
                 sbatch 
"/opt/slurm/bin/sbatch" 

$args
[1] "/path/to/nonmem/models/submission-log/1001.sh"

$template_script
[1] "#!/bin/bash <rest of template omitted>"

$partition
[1] "cpu16mem64gb"
```

### Using the `slurm_job_template_path` argument
By default, `submit_slurm_job` uses `getOption('slurmtools.slurm_job_template_path')` for the path to the template file (see [Getting Started Guide](/slurmtools-docs/guides/getting_started) if you're unfamiliar with the `slurmtools` options). You can update this argument to use a different template file as needed.

import submit_code_path from '/src/code/submit_path.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code_path}/>

### Using the `submission_root` argument
This directory is used to track submission scripts and output. It will be populated with the shell scripts created from filling in the template file when calling `submit_slurm_job` and the stdout/stderr from the bash script. If you would like to set it and forget it use the `slurmtools` option `options('slurmtools.submission_root')` (see the [Getting Started Guide](/slurmtools-docs/guides/getting_started) if you are unfamiliar with this option). If you'd like to set this at runtime simply provide the path to the directory you'd like to save the output to. 

import submit_code_root from '/src/code/submit_path.R?raw';

<Code title="submit_job.R" lang="r" code={submit_code_root}/>

<Aside type="note">
If the directory does not exists, `submit_slurm_job` will create it.

### Using the `bbi_config_path` argument
If you are using [`bbi`](https://github.com/metrumresearchgroup/bbi)<Icon name='external'/> to submit nonmem jobs this specifies the path to the bbi config file `bbi.yaml`. By default, `submit_slurm_job` uses the `slurmtools` option `options('slurmtools.bbi_config_path)` (see the [Getting Started Guide](/slurmtools-docs/guides/getting_started) if you are unfamiliar with this option). If you would like to use a different configuration for `bbi` you can specify the path to a new config file and use that.

import submit_code_bbi from '/src/code/submit_bbi.R?raw';

<Code title='submit_job.R' lang='r' code={submit_code_bbi}/>

### Using the `slurm_template_opts` argument

If additional arguments are needed in your template file, pass them via `slurm_template_opts` as a named list. For example, to set an email for notifications:.

import submit_code_opts from '/src/code/submit_opts.R?raw';

<Code title='submit_job.R' lang='r' code={submit_code_opts}/>

This will cause any instances of `{{email}}` in your template file to be replaced with `matthews@a2-ai.com`. If you are unfamiliar with template file structure, please see the guide on [writing template files](/slurmtools-docs/guies/simple_template_file)
