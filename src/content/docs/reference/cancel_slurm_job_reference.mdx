This guide assumes you are familiar with cancelling NONMEM jobs using the [default arguments](/guides/cancel_slurm_job), and are looking for more control over you job submission. We'll cover each argument to `cancel_slurm_job` and overriding the default.

### Using the `confirm` argument
<Aside type='danger'>
This argument allows you to automatically cancel jobs without confirming
</Aside>

By default, `cancel_slurm_job` makes you confirm the cancellation before the job is cancelled. With `confirm = FALSE` you can electively turn off this confirmation and cancel the job.

import cancel_other_confirm from '/src/cancel_job_confirm.R?raw'

<Code title="cancel_job.R" lang="r" code={cancel_other_confirm} />
