This guide will expand upon how to write a template file to incorporate [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) notifications! 
> ntfy (pronounced notify) is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. It allows you to send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, and/or using a REST API. It's infinitely flexible, and 100% free software.

## Prerequisites
<Steps>
1. Familiarity with [`submit_slurm_job`](/guides/submit_slurm_job)
2. Familiarity with [simple template files](guides/simple_template_file)
</Steps>

We can start by adding a notification when the job starts and when it ends. Looking at the [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) website we can see:

>Publishing messages can be done via PUT or POST. Topics are created on the fly by subscribing or publishing to them. If you use ntfy without sign-up, the topic is essentially a password, so pick something that's not easily guessable. If you purchase ntfy Pro, you can reserve topic names instead.

With the command to do this is:
```
curl -d "Backup successful ðŸ˜€" ntfy.sh/mytopic
```

We can add this command to our template file to fire off before the nonmem job starts and immediately after it finishes. 

import tmpl from '/src/code/ntfy-template.tmpl?raw';

<Code title='slurm-job.tmpl' lang='bash' code={tmpl}/>

We can provide the needed arguments (`mytopic` and `ntfy`) through the [`slurm_template_opts` argument](/reference/submit_slurm_job_reference#using-the-slurm_template_opts-argument) using the following call to [`submit_slurm_job`](guides/submit_slurm_job)

import submit from '/src/code/ntfy-submit.R?raw';

<Code title='ntfy-submit.R' lang='r' code={submit}/>

This sends off two messages to [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh):
